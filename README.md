# ðŸŽµ RagaMatch

**Classical Roots. Modern Intelligence.**

RagaMatch is an AI-powered application that identifies Indian classical music ragas from audio files in seconds. Built with React frontend and FastAPI backend, it uses deep learning models to analyze audio features and provide accurate raga predictions.

IMPORTANT: The currently implemented TDNN+LSTM+Attention model pipeline achieves a ~92% test accuracy but does NOT generalize well to audio outside the dataset. This issue is currently being investigated and will hopefully be fixed soon.
